NanoCodeAgent is a teaching-oriented C++ code agent runtime focused on deterministic execution, workspace safety, and incremental capability building.

It is intentionally positioned as a local, controlled runtime rather than a cloud-first black-box automation platform. The current repository focuses on building the core agent loop, tool safety boundaries, and a development workflow that can later dogfood stronger coding and documentation agents.

## Current Status

`Phase 0` is complete. The current baseline includes:

- CLI and runtime configuration
- Agent loop and tool-calling basics
- HTTP / LLM integration and SSE streaming
- Safety-bounded `read`, `write`, and `bash` tools
- Test infrastructure and deterministic mdBook validation

For documentation, the main branch now keeps only deterministic mdBook build and structure checks. AI-generated documentation is not part of the mainline workflow at this stage.

## Quick Start

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
./build.sh        # build in Debug mode
./build.sh test   # build and run all tests
```

## Roadmap

### Phase 0

Completed runtime baseline:

- [x] repository scaffold, CMake build, and CLI entrypoint
- [x] config precedence and workspace sandbox
- [x] HTTP client and basic LLM request plumbing
- [x] SSE parser and streaming response handling
- [x] tool registry and `tool_call` aggregation
- [x] secure workspace `write` tool
- [x] secure workspace `read` tool
- [x] bounded `bash` execution with timeout and process control
- [x] multi-turn agent loop with loop limits
- [x] mock/live-path test hardening and streaming robustness

### Phase 1

Goal: complete a stronger coding workflow loop inside a repository.

- [x] add `apply_patch` as a first-class mutation primitive
- [x] add `git_status` with structured branch, ahead/behind, and per-file change listing
- [x] add `git_diff` and `git_show` for read-only diff and commit history inspection
- [x] add `rg_search` and bounded `list_files_bounded` for repository search
- [x] introduce `ToolRegistry` typed dispatch with `ToolCategory` and `requires_approval` metadata
- [ ] enforce mutation vs read-only tool policy and approval gate at runtime
- [ ] add patch validation and rejection flow before writeback
- [ ] support bounded build/test execution loops for CMake and `ctest`
- [ ] improve failure recovery and retry guidance from tool results
- [ ] add explicit commit packaging flow with `git_add` and `git_commit`

### Phase 2

Goal: decouple reusable workflows into Skills.

- [ ] define the skill directory convention and metadata/frontmatter shape
- [ ] implement a skill loader for workspace and shared skill locations
- [ ] inject selected skills into prompt/session assembly
- [ ] add built-in skills for C++ conventions, testing workflow, and git workflow
- [ ] expose skill enablement through CLI and config
- [ ] add skill execution traces and debugging output
- [ ] dogfood one real repository maintenance workflow through skills

### Docs Agent Milestone

This starts after `Phase 2`, not before.

- [ ] manually run NanoCodeAgent over repo docs, code, and diff context in one workflow
- [ ] generate a documentation plan and patch as a manual agent task
- [ ] ship a `Docs Maintainer` skill instead of a CI-side doc generator
- [ ] reconsider automation only after repeated stable manual dogfooding

## Future Directions

Longer-term directions stay centered on the runtime itself:

- MCP integration
- Telegram or other remote interfaces
- finer-grained sandbox and permission models
- stronger autonomous coding workflows
